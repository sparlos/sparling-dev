emoji bank: ⬜️ ✅ 🐞 🤔 💡 🛠 (🤔 = potential feature, stretch 💡 = core feature)

--------------------

✅ 🐞 - Chrome android, status bar disappearing on scroll in /about causes BG gradient to not cover 100% of the height of the page
✅ 🐞 - scrolling not working on small screens for home page, very small height makes buttons unclickable
✅ 🐞 - prevent overflow for large background icons on hover of buttons for home page
⬜️ 🤔 - switch home game to canvas rendering to optimize performance, make entity positions not dependent on state (use react-game-engine?)
✅ 🛠 - refactor BigToggle to at least separate out animations/refactor to make it cleaner
✅ 💡 - ability to navigate to the projects-and-skills page with a pre-defined toggle state (i.e. a link that automatically selects either projects or skills - URL query param, different route altogether? see what works best w/ next)
⬜️ 🛠 - update react-select to completely use tailwind styling (clear button, delete chip button, etc.)
✅ 🛠 - completely remove dropdown for skills page, since it's not really necessary
⬜️ 🐞 - fix "quit game" button positioning now that nav menu exists (overlaps)
⬜️ 🐞 - home page -> "what I do" -> select projects -> select "vue.js" or "next.js" from dropdown -> projects/experience selector distorts vertically
